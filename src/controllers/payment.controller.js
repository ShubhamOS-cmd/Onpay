// here we make our payment all controllers
// we make an another model for paymnet history
// problem is if i made a model
// {
//     user1: "who send money to other",
//     user2: "who receive from user1",
// }

// and when i send user1 their data of payment history it collections of basically data where user1 only send money 
// nut what if any user send money to user1 
// the model which i discuss is about to only send money but what about if user1 is recieve money

// this file is dedicated to only payment related 
// if i want to get history then i do this in usercontroller
